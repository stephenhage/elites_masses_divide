# Measure the gap between 'Elites' and the rest of us

One very-concerning trend in the US has been the growing gap between the fabulously wealthy and the poor. We see the same phenomenon in coastal cities and "middle America". The divide between our most highly-educated, wealthy, famous people and everyone else appears to be growing.

This analysis will attempt to use data science techniques to measure the divide in different realms of life:
+ Entertainment
+ Political Opinions
+ Wealth
+ News and Information Sources

One challenge to surmount, from the outset, is identifying who qualifies as "elite". It's not always the wealthy or well-educated. As an example, when evaluating the divide in entertainment, the "elite" might be the officially credentialed movie critics, while the rest are individual reviews. With political opinions it may be Twitter blue-checkmarks vs. everyone else.
